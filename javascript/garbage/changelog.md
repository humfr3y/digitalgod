Finally! After 2 weeks I finish this update. It's biggest update in the history of game. I have seen so many bugs and errors, and so much or a little less i solved. The hardest thing for me was to figure out how to remove blue (purchased) color for 4-6 upgrades. I spent two days on this, and it's the reason why i abandoned the game for 2 weeks. The rest bugs were "Problem on a problem" when after solving one, another appeared, btw it was the reason to fix that "hardest" bug. I wanted to make changing language button, and it turned out to suffer and fix that bug. Well it wasn't hard. I'm glad i finished this update and didn't abandon it. I'll be really glad if you play it at least for a little and those works, that time i spent for making update (3-7 hours per day) will not pass in vain. What about name of the game? Let me explain with small lore: You, a poor creature, aspire to become a God in virtual reality, but you need incredible power of God, which lies in the some coins that you collect during the game and then spend to get even more. Each currency makes you stronger and more powerful. However will everything will be simple? Will Fortune help this time?

15.02.2023 | My1stClicker 0.5.1.
Design changes:

Well i continued it and i did something good even with zero html and css skills, it's really impressive and i really should learn them both later.
There a really much things which i should do, and which i dont know how to do. Also i tried to add icons for buttons but when you buying upgrades it disappears, i should to link it somehow...
